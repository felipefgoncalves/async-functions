# Asynchronous Functions
In this example, I will show you how to handle this kind of functions.

Using the `index.js` file as an orchestrator, the `main()` function is responsible for calling the functions from the other files in the order that we want.

## Keep in mind ðŸ¤“

As we are using **async/await** functions, we need to use await to call the functions

- Promise is a **class** that is used to handle asynchronous calls;
- Await is used to **wait** for the asynchronous call to finish;
- All async functions **returns a promise**;
